Introduction
In these exercises we'll apply groupwise analysis to our dataset.

Run the code cell below to load the data before running the exercises.

1.
Who are the most common wine reviewers in the dataset? Create a Series whose index is the taster_twitter_handle category from the dataset, and whose values count how many reviews each person wrote.

add Codeadd Markdown
reviews_written = ____
# Your code here
reviews_written = reviews.groupby('taster_twitter_handle').size()
​
# Check your answer
q1.check()
Correct:

reviews_written = reviews.groupby('taster_twitter_handle').size()
or

reviews_written = reviews.groupby('taster_twitter_handle').taster_twitter_handle.count()

2.
What is the best wine I can buy for a given amount of money? Create a Series whose index is wine prices and whose values is the maximum number of points a wine costing that much was given in a review. Sort the values by price, ascending (so that 4.0 dollars is at the top and 3300.0 dollars is at the bottom).

add Codeadd Markdown
best_rating_per_price = ____
best_rating_per_price = reviews.groupby('price')['points'].max().sort_index()

What are the minimum and maximum prices for each variety of wine? Create a DataFrame whose index is the variety category from the dataset and whose values are the min and max values thereof.

add Codeadd Markdown
price_extremes = ____
price_extremes = reviews.groupby('variety').price.agg([min, max])

What are the most expensive wine varieties? Create a variable sorted_varieties containing a copy of the dataframe from the previous question where varieties are sorted in descending order based on minimum price, then on maximum price (to break ties).

add Codeadd Markdown
sorted_varieties = ____
sorted_varieties = price_extremes.sort_values(by=['min', 'max'], ascending=False)

Create a Series whose index is reviewers and whose values is the average review score given out by that reviewer. Hint: you will need the taster_name and points columns.

add Codeadd Markdown
reviewer_mean_ratings = ____
reviewer_mean_ratings = reviews.groupby('taster_name').points.mean()
​
# Check your answer

Are there significant differences in the average scores assigned by the various reviewers? Run the cell below to use the describe() method to see a summary of the range of values.

add Codeadd Markdown
reviewer_mean_ratings.describe()
count    19.000000
mean     88.233026
std       1.243610
min      85.855422
25%      87.323501
50%      88.536235
75%      88.975256
max      90.562551
Name: points, dtype: float64

6.
What combination of countries and varieties are most common? Create a Series whose index is a MultiIndexof {country, variety} pairs. For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to {"US", "Pinot Noir"}. Sort the values in the Series in descending order based on wine count.

add Codeadd Markdown
country_variety_counts = reviews.groupby(['country', 'variety']).size().sort_values(ascending=False)
